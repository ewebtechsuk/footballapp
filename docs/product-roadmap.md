# Kickr Product Roadmap Priorities

This roadmap focuses on features that differentiate Kickr by blending competitor strengths with the gaps identified in [competitor_analysis.md](../competitor_analysis.md).

## Now (Foundational Differentiators)
- **Multi-role architecture:** Define admin, coach, player, parent/fan permissions for scheduling, messaging, payments, and analytics so every stakeholder has the right tools without friction.[^teamstats][^firstwhistle]
- **Comprehensive scheduling:** Support recurring events, shared calendars, RSVP automation, and push notifications for matches and training inspired by the seamless booking flows seen in casual platforms.[^footyaddicts]
- **Roster and player management:** Extend player profiles with availability, health, statistics, and unlimited squad sizes, combining grassroots discovery strengths with TeamStats-level administration.[^teamstats][^findaplayer]

## Next (Engagement and Intelligence)
- **Real-time communication hub:** Deliver team, match-specific, and direct messaging with WebSockets/Firebase for reliable updates plus digest summaries, expanding beyond simple announcements.[^firstwhistle]
- **Assignments and coaching tools:** Allow coaches to assign drills, monitor completion, and share resources, filling a gap none of the reviewed competitors currently address.
- **Payments and finances:** Integrate Stripe/PayPal for dues, tournament entry, merchandise, and one-off fees, pairing TeamStats’ finance rigor with FirstWhistle’s automation.[^teamstats][^firstwhistle]
- **Advanced analytics and leaderboards:** Provide live match tracking, AI-driven insights, lineup recommendations, and season-long leaderboards to outpace lightweight stat summaries.[^firstwhistle][^ftplay]

## Later (Global Expansion and Monetisation)
- **Global team discovery & challenge mode:** Combine map-based discovery with the ability to challenge teams worldwide, adding filters for skill, age, and gender to extend Find a Player’s reach.[^findaplayer]
- **Social feed & fan accounts:** Introduce highlight reels, match reports, polls, and volunteer callouts so supporters can engage without needing admin access, mirroring social strengths from Footy Addicts while broadening scope.[^footyaddicts]
- **Offline and multi-language support:** Ensure critical workflows function with limited connectivity and localise key experiences to accelerate adoption in new regions.
- **Media uploads & wearable integration:** Enable video/audio sharing and ingestion of fitness-tracker data to deepen performance analytics for staff and players.[^squaded]
- **E-commerce and fundraising:** Launch a marketplace for gear, ticketing, and fundraising campaigns to diversify revenue streams alongside payments.[^footyaddicts]
- **Custom branding and user customisation:** Offer club themes, family account hierarchies, and dynamic registration flows to help organisations reflect their identity and manage complex rosters.[^teamstats]

Sequencing these initiatives ensures Kickr quickly matches core expectations (Now), then compounds engagement and insights (Next), and finally scales into a global, monetisable ecosystem (Later).
